# SE L3T13 - Task 3

Compulsory Task 3

One innovative technology using NLP is Googleâ€™s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a pre-trained language processing model that can be used for various NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition. The main achievement of BERT is in improving the accuracy of natural language understanding tasks by using deep neural networks.

BERT is based on the transformer architecture, which allows it to take into account the context of words in a sentence or paragraph, thus improving the quality of its predictions. It achieves this by training on a large corpus of text to learn contextual relationships between words. This contextual understanding allows BERT to better understand the nuances of natural language and provide more accurate results. BERT has been integrated into several Google products, including search and language translation, to provide more accurate results and better user experience.
